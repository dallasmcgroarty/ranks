# ranks
Ranks is a mobile first free score card web app. 

Users can add player cards which contain the player's name and score and dynamically update their score through some plus and minus buttons. No database used. Everything is strictly done using local storage. This way it is super light weight, fast, and non-invasive. 

Developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 

Currently still developing and working on additions/bug fixes. But the app is fully functional. 

Desktop site is currently not formatted nicely since it isn't meant to be used on the desktop, but I may work on that at some point. 

If on iOS, disable private browsing in order to allow access to local storage.
